## Introduction

In today's world, voice recognition technology is becoming essential in various applications. The **Wakeword** project simplifies the process of integrating wakeword detection into your ESP32S3-based devices. Whether you're building a smart home assistant or a voice-controlled gadget, this project provides a solid foundation.

## Features

- **Ready-to-go ML Model**: Pre-trained models for quick deployment.
- **ESP32S3 Compatibility**: Designed specifically for the ESP32S3 DevKitC-1.
- **Edge AI**: Run machine learning models directly on the device for low latency.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple instructions to get started.
- **Community Support**: Join a growing community of developers.

## Getting Started

To begin, you need to set up your development environment. Ensure you have the following:

- **ESP32S3 DevKitC-1**: The hardware platform for this project.
- **Arduino IDE**: The preferred IDE for ESP32 development.
- **Basic knowledge of C/C++**: Familiarity with programming will help you customize the project.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the Arduino IDE.
2. Set up the ESP32 board in the Arduino IDE.
3. Download the necessary libraries for audio processing.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techAli1996/wakeword.git
